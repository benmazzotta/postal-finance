The Universal Postal Union reports postal income from financial services for many countries around the world.

Data are reported in national historic series up to 2012. Countries may report gross earnings in Special Drawing Rights (SDR), a weighted basket of currencies calculated by the IMF for central bankers and sovereign lending.

This file summarizes the availability of data for selected countries.


```{r UPU, fig.width=10, fig.height=6.1}
load(file="../data/UPU.Rda")
summary(df)

## How many country-years of data?
dim(df)

## How many observations per country?
table(df$iso3c)

## How many observations by type of data?
table(df$Items, !is.na(df$Value))


```

What do postal services report for the share of revenue from financial services?

```{r finsvc, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

## Plot the distribution
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(subset(df, varname=="finsvc"), aes(Value), fill=varname) +geom_density(fill="red") + labs(title="What percent of postal revenues come from financial services?", x="Percent of gross revenues",y="Density estimate") 

ggplot(subset(df, varname=="finsvc"), aes(Region, Value)) + geom_boxplot() +coord_flip() + labs(title="What percent of postal revenues come from financial services? \n Boxplots by Region", x="Region",y="Percent of gross revenues")

```
